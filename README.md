The project has been made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

The project is a simple stopwatch that has three buttons i.e. Start, Stop and Reset.

Time is calculated using the setTimeout function that calls itself every 1000 milliseconds i.e. 1 second.
After every 60 seconds the value of minute will increase by 1 and the value of seconds will turn 0. After every 60 minutes the value of hour will increase by 1 and the value of minutes will turn 0.

Start button starts the timer.
Stop button stops the timer.
Reset button resets the timer value to 0.
